An inscrutable adventure game as a drone sequencer

## Dev Log
**2/26/2024**
Decided to build out the initial sketch in seamstress before moving to norns. The truth is it might work better as a seamstress app than a norns app at all, but I'm going to push that consideration down the line and focus on making the most of the tighter dev loop. The vision is for it to be a curious norns thing more than an app running on the computer. We'll see.

FWIW I described the concept yesterday to my friend as a "drone sequencer that you program by playing a game like Deja Vu in an incomprehensible language where each action  alters the state of the sound and the events loop in recorded time behind the most recent action, expanding with each choice."

I was originally going to call it The Garden of Forking Paths, but as I dug back into Borges the story I settled on for a namesake resonated more with the idea in the corner of my mindâ€”straining to make something real from a dream in an incomprehensible environment. We'll see. Might change again.
