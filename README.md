# Asterion
An inscrutable adventure game as a drone sequencer

Asterion is an unconventional musical instrument. It's an art project. It's a noisy corridor simulator with gloom modulation, a sequencer programmed a move at a time by exploring a randomly generated maze. Past steps dog your heels as your actions play back upon you. It's a paean to [Jorge Luis Borges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_of_Asterion).

"All the parts of the house are repeated many times, any place is another place."

Each floor of the labyrinth is generated at random with a couple of simple rules for distributing keys and locks.

Use arrow keys or `W, A, S, D` to navigate. Collect keys with `SPACE` or `ENTER`. Unlock doors with the same. Adjust the root note and amperage in the params menu.

A word of WARNING: Care has been take to tame the drone, but it has some jump scare qualities that should be explored at moderate volumes as you begin to explore the instrument.

Run the following in maiden to install:
`;install https://github.com/cachilders/asterion.git`

You will need to restart (possibly twice) for the Asterion engine to be compiled by norns.
